# Scenario 1

> Alice is a musician with several years of experience of using custom input controllers as part of their musical workflow. These controllers are typically used within the DMI paradigm and thus Alice has experience using the libmapper project as a middle ware solution for connecting her input controller to an external synthesizer. Toby is a friend of Alice’s who recently showed her a new browser-based synthesizer they’ve been working on developing. During the demo, Alice expressed interest in mapping some of her libmapper-compatible input devices to parameters of Toby’s new web-based synthesizer.

This scenario is all about establishing a mapping between a web-based synthesizer and some arbitrary input controller.

## Scenario Implementation

To run this scenario, start a web-server in this directory using the command `http-server`.
