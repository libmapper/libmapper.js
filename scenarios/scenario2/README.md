# Scenario 2

> Aaron is a web-developer with over five years of experience working with HTML & JavaScript in a professional context. Recently Aaron has become interested in multi-media performances, and is looking for a way to connect several components heâ€™s been working on developing. Aaron would like to leverage his web-development skills to develop an input controller with knobs, sliders, and other input options.

This scenario is all about using web-technologies to build a front-end GUI that can then be mapped to other components of a multi-media system.

## Scenario Implementation

To run this scenario, start a web-server in this directory using the command `http-server`.
