# Scenario 3

> Sarah is a regular libmapper user that is interested in using the middleware as a communication protocol across browser tabs. After working with libmapper as part of several different DMI projects, Sarah is eager to explore how working with libmapper in the browser can allow her to develop new web-based projects using familiar tooling and mapping paradigms. While Sarahâ€™s project is exploratory in nature, basing her work on existing mental models is important to her creative workflow

This scenario is focused on using the libmapper ecosystem to create a mapping between two (or more) web-browser tabs.

## Scenario Implementation

To run this scenario, start a web-server in this directory using the command `http-server`.
